# Etch-A-Sketch Project

A fun interactive web app where users can draw by hovering over a grid. The grid can be reset and customized based on user input.

## Demo

You can try the Etch-A-Sketch directly in the browser.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure for the Etch-A-Sketch app.
- `assets/css/styles.css`: The stylesheet that defines the look and feel of the Etch-A-Sketch grid.
- `assets/js/app.js`: The JavaScript code that controls the app's functionality, including grid creation, random color generation, and mouse events.

## Features

- **Grid Creation**: Users can create a grid of squares where each square can be colored by hovering over it.
- **Random Colors**: Each square changes color to a random RGB value when hovered.
- **Opacity**: The color opacity decreases as the user hovers over a square multiple times, creating a fading effect.
- **Reset**: The grid can be reset at any time by clicking the "Reset" button.
- **Custom Grid Size**: Users can enter their preferred grid size (number of squares per side) when resetting the grid. The grid will be created accordingly.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click the "Reset" button to reset the grid or prompt the user to choose a new grid size.
3. Hover over the grid squares to draw on the screen.
4. The grid size can be changed by entering a number when prompted.
